            <h3>have you ever messed up?</h3>
            <p>Every living human has their body, <br>and a brain that learns how to nod, <br>and blossoming social intuition helps a child grow up. <br>If you don&apos;t have the social rulebook, the calculations are a pain. <br>A manual plugging in of cues grows complicated, lasting longer and longer. <br>Less adept people need the time to learn it on their own.</p>
            <p>This is the burden you shoulder on your own. <br>You&apos;ve conditioned yourself to ignore the inconvenience because you&apos;ve always lived in this body. <br>Every year, the list of cues and experiences grows longer <br>Gesture, tilt your head, don&apos;t raise your hand, raise your hand, wait quietly, step louder as you enter the room so that you don&apos;t scare your roommates, pay attention with a light nod. <br>All of the fingers on your hands break through your skin, and you map the pain. <br>Every mental comprehension is stored up. </p>
            <p>But have you ever messed up? <br>Like the moment you pick at someone&apos;s skin and they grimace in pain? <br>Your nails dig, leaving indentations and marks that match your own. <br>They flinch away from the contact of your body <br>You press fingers past the sutures of their skulls until you feel under their cranium, until you know their signs, signals, signifiers that represent the moment they want you to laugh or nod. <br>The assumption transforms introspection into obsessive, apocalyptic thoughts that only stretch longer. </p>
            <p>The days are once again longer. <br>Looking at the sky, you tilt your chin up. <br>You look back down in a drawn out nod. <br>You walk to the library on your own. <br>The disappearance of your friends once wracked your body. <br>You still do not know how to embrace the thought of measured pain.</p>
            <p>You tried again and and now your body shakes in pain. <br>The drive to the ER has never felt longer. <br>The worst part is the tightness in your body. <br>You hold your hands up. <br>The numbness is mostly gone, they&apos;re back to being the hands you own. <br>It takes self-control, but when the nurse recommends taking a walk to relieve anxiety, you simply nod.</p>
            <p>As you retell this story, all your therapist will do is nod. <br>Her job is to calculate how to sensitize you to the dissonance of social pain. <br>She knows one day you will find people who do not cling to their own. <br>She knows that your breaths can draw out longer. <br>She knows that you can lift your eyes up. <br>She knows that you will admire the world beyond your body.</p>
            <p>With a nod to the girl, you wait a while longer. <br>The pain of seeing her has drowned itself, then dried up. <br>The withered husk stays upright on its own, but you&apos;ve weeded all of the shame out of your body.</p>

            <p>it flits and drifts</p>
            <p>i scan The Moon, a goddess to someone, loved and revered. She is a rock to me, and i scan the craters over and over. not to memorize, no, my desolate, cavernous brain couldn&apos;t if it wanted to. i admire Her. the slow pull of gravity, the luminance of a giving sun, it brightens in a fuzzy halo that it shares with the atmosphere. the clouds are curling, the wind a breath of a giant i call my father. these things change, shift, but never leave.</p>
            <p>in the sky</p>
            <p>visible to smile at me,</p>
            <p>The Moon stretches full.</p>

            <p>me.</p>
            <p>I am the center of my own universe, everyone says that&apos;s a bad thing but I know it&apos;s good, it&apos;s the flow of the world pushing through me but I still hold the same position, arms outstretched and reaching towards stars in opposite direction, warming the bones and the sinews that contain consciousness, and heating a collection of moments that the honorable call a soul. I am the cradle of beginnings and lives and endings. resting on pillows, the universe creates and processes and moves with rapid eyes. the center of all beautiful things rests in newly laundered bedsheets.</p>
            <p>we.</p>
            <p>pull out everything from our teeth to our childhood playlists, roll our eyes at the flaws that we see in the people we loved, take off the labels and smiles formed by the random chance of unseen luck. uncover that nothingness the space that all objects in the universe hold between our neutrons, and behold the tree that grew taller than we could ever be. the leaves always pitched through the window of the house we grew too big to fit in.</p>

            <p>we&apos;ve grown up since I last curled up near your feet. our world is not imploding on itself, the eyes hiding behind the pictures in our home have permanently shut. we sleep in beds draped in layers of late bedtimes and rgb keyboards. distance is the real love and hate.</p>

            <p>they can see everything,<br>so little me couldn&apos;t dare think it</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>the universe does not experience supernovas. it lives through implosions and indentations in pillow cases. sad sack, bed head, sideways keyboards, all universal truths
            the bed feels mealy today.</p>

            <p>Something has budgedâ€¦<br>It crawls, but it still<br>Presents itself as a small<br>Sluice of a solution.

            <p>where&apos;d it go?<br>all the screaming<br>not even an echo now<br>blue screen<br>no explosion or implosion, it feels like a <br>jump cut<br>the sudden silence feels like relief<br>in the wake of a former friend</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>the noise gone,<br>i see the trauma of a human made of muscle and blood<br>connection, the tethers are hard to keep attached</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>the universe can&apos;t swallow the pill. it sticks, bitter. the universe coughs.</p>       
            <p>&ndash;</p>         
            <p>there&apos;s a pill for that<br>why does this feel like that</p>  
            <p>&ndash;</p>              
            <p>you&apos;d think that medication manufacturers would know better than to flavor pills without a warning. some people would chew the paper without looking but the anxious would have the clues that they aren&apos;t paranoid. they could know that anxiety now tastes like a nilla wafer, and not morning breath</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>you swallow the rattle down the throat. you think about how the little pellets would taste. you feel bad for the pill shy that accidentally crush the pellets if they chew the applesauce. turns out the rattle was still connected to the snake, and the feeling in your blood morphs you into someone who can finish the weeks-late essay that sits on your chest at night. it will keep you up at night as the antivenin works to increase your tolerance. rattle and snake and venom and antivenom.</p>          
            <p>&ndash;</p>  
            <p>the fickle chemical. sweet, ever willing to help you feel better for a time, but you need to up the dose. up up up up up. did you take it this morning? are you really truly on it? have you taken it at all? it doesn&apos;t feel like the pill has ever crossed your lips. maybe you&apos;re the first and only person ever who is unfixable, unprescribable (you are not the first who feels this, even in your family). the doctor knows what she&apos;s doing though. you trust her. so you take a tablet and a half of sugar every morning.</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>it tastes bad. the circles feel so good, life changing and comforting all at once. they should paint mini pixelated smiley faces on them because they deserve to be admired. but they smell like dad&apos;s breath after he fasts. you don&apos;t remember the last time your life felt tinged with the positive. your saturated thoughts are kneaded into a moldable eraser that reveals the calm screentones behind the layer of graphite clouded on the inside of the cranium.</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>the only one you hope to stop using someday. all you need is an air conditioned unit and more control over your surroundings. and a vacuum. the feeling of the liquid in your nose solidifying is ambivalent.</p>
            <p>&ndash;</p>
            <p>caffeine is dangerous.<br>my school told me so</p>
            <p>an old friend that stuck around out of convenience. it was running a marathon over a mountain and wanting anything to work after the finish line gets crossed. no matter how much you train, no matter what you do, you recover afterwards. no matter how much your body needs to be there, your prediction of the mountains coming in backlit lcd on a cardio machine will not save you from the stumbling crash.</p>
            <p>it takes the screaming shower head and changes it to a sprinkle in a shallow swimming pool. a tiny white circle with that proves your independence from the people who don&apos;t need you when you&apos;re struggling. they leave you with a vision that turns into frosted glass at the corners. you know how bad something has to be to want the creeping fog. this is not fun. it&apos;s safe.</p>
